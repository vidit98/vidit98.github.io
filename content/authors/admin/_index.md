Hi, I am Vidit Goel currently working as Machine Learning Engineer at Snap Inc based out of Los Angeles. For the past few years I have majorly worked in computer vision including image generation and segmentation. I am passionate about applying my knowledge to build products and learn things along the way. I believe that artificial intelligence can augment our lives in various positive ways and want to focus my knowledge and skills in doing the same. I am always exicted to meet new people and discuss ideas either it be products, companies or in general AI.
